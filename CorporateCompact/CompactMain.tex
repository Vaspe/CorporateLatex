\section{Using LaTeX to make documents that meet NREL's requirements}

A LaTeX class called \emph{CorporateCompact.cls} has been written that implements corporate formatting requirements in LaTeX, but is oriented towards shorter documents.

This document is based on an extract from the \emph{CorporateArticle.cls} demonstration document.

\subsection{Functionality}
The \emph{CorporateCompact.cls} style file has all of the functionality of the \emph{CompactArticle} class and is based on the standard LaTeX article class. It uses reduced spacing for the title, section headings, and lists compared to \emph{CorporateArticle.cls}. Citations can be included if required.
