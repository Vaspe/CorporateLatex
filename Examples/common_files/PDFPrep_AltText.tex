Alternative text, or `Alt text', is a textual description of an equation, link or figure that can be used to replace the visual information in that element. This is often seen as a text `pop-up' in PDF readers. 

At this time Alt text cannot be added reliably withing LaTeX. Instead, it should be added after the PDF is compiled using a PDF editor such as Adobe's Acrobat Pro.
