The \texttt{listings} package has been loaded. Note: this does not work if the `Draft' document option is used.

To change the syntax highlighting use \verb+\lstset{language=[dialect]language, columns=fullflexible, keepspaces=true}+ before each listing where the language changes. For more details see the \texttt{lstlisting} documentation.
